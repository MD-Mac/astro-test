# Best Time to Visit Kenya for Safari

Kenya offers incredible wildlife viewing year-round, but certain times of the year provide truly exceptional experiences. Here's everything you need to know about planning your safari timing.

## The Great Migration (July - October)

The most famous wildlife spectacle on Earth happens when over 2 million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles cross the Mara River. This dramatic event typically occurs between July and October.

### What to expect:
- **River crossings**: Heart-stopping moments as herds brave crocodile-infested waters
- **Predator action**: Lions, leopards, and cheetahs follow the herds
- **Crowded parks**: This is peak season, so expect more visitors

## Dry Season (June - October)

The dry season offers the best overall game viewing conditions:

- **Easier wildlife spotting**: Animals gather around water sources
- **Clear skies**: Perfect for photography
- **Minimal rainfall**: Better road conditions

## Wet Season (November - May)

Don't overlook the wet season benefits:

- **Lower prices**: Significant savings on accommodations and flights
- **Lush landscapes**: Beautiful green scenery
- **Baby animals**: Many species give birth during this time
- **Fewer crowds**: More intimate wildlife experiences

## Pro Tips for Any Season

1. **Book early**: Especially for peak migration season
2. **Pack layers**: Temperatures can vary dramatically
3. **Bring binoculars**: Essential for spotting distant wildlife
4. **Stay flexible**: Weather can change safari plans

No matter when you visit Kenya, you're guaranteed an unforgettable adventure!
